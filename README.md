A small application with GUI to save recipes and print out shopping lists for either selected or randomized recipes. Only in Finnish.

Written in Python, the main GUI uses Tkinter. Designed for personal use, the application is only in Finnish.

One can add and remove food recipes with the application and create shopping lists for the ingredients.
The application adds the ingredients up so if there's 2 onions in one recipe and 3 onions in another, the show up as 5 onions together in the shopping list.
